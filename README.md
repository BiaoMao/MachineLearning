My code for Machine and Computational Learning (CSCI 4100/6100), RPI


Use different kinds of Machine Learning Algorithms such as RBF, SVM and Neural Network to recognize hand-written digits automatically. The data are divided into training and test groups. The in-sample and out of sample errors are compared among different algorithms
